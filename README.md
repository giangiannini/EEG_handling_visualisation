# EEG_handling_visualisation
This repository contains the code and the files necessary to follow through the tutorial given on the 21/11/24 to the "Diverse Brain" students at the FU Berlin.

The repository is organised in the following way:
- Scripts --> folder containing the scripts necessary for the tutorial
- Utils --> extra files needed for analyses and plotting
- ID01 --> contains the raw data of one participant (to analyse together)
- ID02 --> contains the raw data of another participant (to analyse singularly)

The tutorial, thought for a non-expert audience, covers the following aspects: 
- EEG functioning and basic concepts
- EEG preprocessing (downsampling, re-referencing, high-pass filtering, epoching, artifact detection, time-locking and data visualisation).

The following toolboxes are needed for the tutorial:
- Fieldtrip (https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20241025)
